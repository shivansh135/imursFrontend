                <h1>Cancellation and Refund Policy</h1>
                <p>
                    As our product is 100% customized to your preferences, we would like to
                    outline our cancellation and refund policy below:{" "}
                </p>
                <h3>Cancellation:</h3>
                <p>
                    Once your magazine goes into the production process, we are unable to offer
                    any refunds or cancellations. This is because your magazine is uniquely
                    created based on your specifications and cannot be resold to other
                    customers.
                </p>
                <h3>Changes to Magazine:</h3>
                <p>
                    After the final draft of your magazine is shared with you, you are allowed
                    to request changes only once. This includes modifications to content,
                    layout, or any other design elements. We will make every effort to
                    accommodate your changes within the scope of the original order, but please
                    note that major changes may result in additional charges and may impact the
                    delivery timeline.
                </p>
                <h3>Refund:</h3>
                <p>
                    Due to the personalized nature of our product and the costs involved in
                    production, we do not offer refunds once the magazine goes into the
                    production process. We are committed to ensuring that you are satisfied with
                    the final product and will work with you to address any concerns or issues
                    that may arise during the process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Please review your order carefully before finalizing it to avoid any
                    discrepancies or changes after the production process has begun. If you have
                    any questions or need further clarification, please feel free to contact our
                    customer support team at support@iamyourstory.in
